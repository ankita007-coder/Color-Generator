Welcome to the Color Palette Generator! This simple web application allows you to create a beautiful color palette based on a color of your choice. You can either enter a specific color code or use the color picker to select a color. When you hit the "Generate Color Palette" button, we will create 10 shades both higher and lower than your chosen color to give you a diverse palette for your creative projects.

How to Use
Input a Color: You can either type in a color code (e.g., #FF5733) or use the color picker to select a color visually.

Generate Color Palette: Click the "Generate Color Palette" button, and our algorithm will create a palette of 21 colors for you. This palette will include your selected color, 10 shades higher, and 10 shades lower.

Copy Color Codes: You can copy the color codes to your clipboard by clicking on them. Use these codes in your design or development work.

Save Your Palette: If you like the palette you've generated, you can save it for future reference.
